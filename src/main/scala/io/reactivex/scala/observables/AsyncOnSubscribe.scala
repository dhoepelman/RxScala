  * An utility class to create `Observable`s that start acting when subscribed to and responds

  * Semantics:
  * * `generator` is called to provide an initial state on each new subscription
  * * `next` is called with the last state and a `requested` amount of items to provide a new state
  *     and an `Observable` that (potentially asynchronously) emits up to `requested` items.
  * * `onUnsubscribe` is called with the state provided by the last `next` call when the observer unsubscribes
